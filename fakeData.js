Subsequently due to changed circumstances this Bank was denationalized in the year 1983 as a private bank and renamed as Pubali Bank Limited. Since inception this Bank has been playing a vital role in socio-economic, industrial and agricultural development as well as in the overall economic development of the country through savings mobilization and investment of funds..",
